# 📖 [Hello-Project] <a name="about-project"></a>

**[Hello-Project]** is to analyze source code and provide feedback on potential errors, coding style violations, other issues and correct them.

### Key Features <a name="Error Detection"></a>

 Analyze the source code and identify potential errors, such as syntax errors, undefined variables, unused variables, and type mismatches. By detecting these errors early, linters help developers catch and fix bugs before they cause runtime issues.

## ❓ FAQ (OPTIONAL) <a name="faq"></a>

- **[What are the system requirements and dependencies for using this project?]**

  - [New developers often want to understand the technical prerequisites for using a project. They might inquire about the required operating systems, programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other dependencies needed to successfully set up and use the project. This information helps them assess compatibility with their development environment and plan accordingly.]

- **[Is there comprehensive documentation or a tutorial available to get started?]**

  - [Documentation and tutorials play a vital role in helping new developers understand how to use a project effectively. They provide guidance on installation, configuration, usage, and troubleshooting. New developers might ask about the availability of documentation, API references, user guides, or sample code to aid their learning process. Clear and accessible documentation significantly reduces the learning curve and facilitates a smooth onboarding experience]s
